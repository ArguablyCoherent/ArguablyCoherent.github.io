 *Hello world!* 

My name is Ronald Alonso, and this is my home page. I'm a student at [CalState University of Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Comp'-Engin'

My Github uername is ArguablyCoherent, and this, my cite, can be found [***right here***](ArguablyCoherent.github.io)

## I take CPSC 120, here are 3 of my favorite labs from the course!

1s lab pick: # & name: 
Lab 2, add libs. Using strings and character inputs to fill preloaded text
This Lab is one of my top 3 favorites because it's the very first Lab we did, and my first time using writing in C++. It's the first time I got to put my studies to the test! 

Lab 8, Olympic judge scores & loop patterns. Using loops to write an algorithm that discards the largest and lowest values before returning an average of what remains. And Using loops to increment counters that are attached to character outputs. The effect of which is a banner like pattern. This one is one of my favorites because it's the first Lab that crashed my computer! The unit test was just so taxing on my old Insperion, the poor sucker just couldn't cope. But thankfully I got it sorted out by handling things in the github codespace.

2. lab # & name:  
Lab 10, CA Counties, and state demographics. Using 2d vectors to contain and retrieve data from vectors and csv files respectively. This is one of my top 3 favorites because I found using vectors of vectors to be very intuitive! I had no problems grasping the concepts, and I had fun bouncing ideas off of my partner to get it done. This was the first time I passed the compiler on the first go!

3. lab # & name: 
Lab 7, parking rules. Using boolians to check flags on when/where we park, to determine if we are allowed to do that. This is one of my top 3 favorites because it felt less like a Lab, and more like a brain teaser. A logic puzzle for how to set up flags that go off in just the right way.
