## I take CPSC 120, here are 3 of my favorite labs from the course!

1. Lab 1:
   Add-libs my beloved! This lab had us using strings and character inputs/outputs to fill gaps in preloaded text,
then print the completed version. This Lab is one of my top 3 favorites because it's the very first Lab we did, and my
first time using writing in C++! It's the first time I got to put my studies to the test! Also, I just like add-libs.
They're a great way to pass the time.

3. lab 7:  
Part 2 of this lab was all about parking rules. Using boolians to check flags on when/where we park, to determine if we are allowed to do that.
This is one of my top 3 favorites because it felt less like a Lab, and more like a brain teaser. A logic puzzle for how to set up flags that
go off in just the right way. i recall having alot of fun finding ways to cut corners on what needed/didn't need to be checked under
different curcumstances.

4. lab 8: 
Part one for this lab was about the process Olympic judges use to give scores. Part 2 was about patterns. Using loops to write an
algorithm that discards the largest and lowest values before returning an average of what remains. And Using loops to increment
counters that are attached to character outputs. The effect of which was a banner like pattern. This one is one of my favorites
because it's the first Lab that crashed my computer! The unit test was just so taxing on my old Insperion, the poor sucker just
couldn't cope. But thankfully I got it sorted out by handling things in the github codespace.
